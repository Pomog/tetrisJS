# Tetris Game Creation Plan

## Objective:
Create a Tetris game using JavaScript (JS) with the following specifications:
- Single-player mode only
- Custom game engine and tools
- Smooth animation at 60 FPS
- Pause menu with continue and restart options
- Scoreboard displaying timer, score, and lives
- Minimal use of layers for rendering optimization
- Plain JS/DOM and HTML only, no frameworks or canvas

## Plan:

1. **Setup HTML Structure:**
   - Create HTML file with necessary elements: game board, score display, timer, pause menu.

2. **Style with CSS:**
   - Apply CSS for visual appeal and user-friendliness.

3. **Implement Game Logic:**
   - Develop JS functions for game mechanics:
     - Generating and displaying Tetris pieces
     - Moving and rotating pieces
     - Collision detection
     - Row clearing
     - Updating score, timer, lives
     - Game over conditions

4. **Smooth Animation with RequestAnimationFrame:**
   - Use `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth rendering.
   - Update game state and render within animation loop.

5. **Keyboard Controls:**
   - Add keyboard event listeners for player input.
   - Ensure smooth piece movement with continuous key pressing.

6. **Pause Menu:**
   - Implement pause menu overlay.
   - Options: continue, restart, settings.
   - Ensure pausing doesn't affect performance.

7. **Optimization and Performance Measurement:**
   - Test performance with browser tools.
   - Address bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
   - Maintain 60 FPS rendering without drops.

8. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Thorough testing for functionality and performance.
   - Debug game mechanics, rendering, input.

9. **Documentation and Refinement:**
   - Document code for clarity.
   - Refactor for readability, maintainability, performance.
   - Gather feedback and refine gameplay.

10. **Final Testing and Deployment:**
    - Test across browsers/devices.
    - Deploy to hosting platform.
